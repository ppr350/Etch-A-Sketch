# Etch-A-Sketch

Project: The Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch challenge.

## Outcome:
- Gain more experience of DOM and its manipulation.
- Hands-on experience of CSS Grid.

## Functionality:
- In this first version, when the mouse moves inside the grid it will fill the cells with black colour.
- I will make a opacity brush in future version, which will add 10% black to the cells each time the mouse moves over them. I will also create a random colour brush that will also add 10% random colours to the cells each time.

## Difficulties I faced:
- I did not know how to make a 16 x 16 grid of square divs. The Odin Project did great job on getting learners used to reading documentations and searching for information ourselves so I wasn't feeling helpless. The project also asks learners to create the divs using JavaScript instead of HTML. But The Odin Project has provided many helpful guides on this topic.
